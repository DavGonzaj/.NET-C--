# Directions
Set up three basic routes for a portfolio page using the MVC structure. For now, the routes should return string values. We will revisit this project after learning how to render HTML pages.

    Build an Index (front) route and render "This is my Index!"

    Build a Projects route and render "These are my projects!"

    Build a Contact route and render "This is my Contact!"
